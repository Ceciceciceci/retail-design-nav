Hello Critical Mass, Dan, and team.

This is my repository for the project for the interview.
This project was tested and ran on my local server at port 8080 using XAMPP.  You will have to store the folder inside named retail-nav in htdocs and run it on your local server and serve it at http://localhost:8080/retail-nav/ .

I did not use as many libraries as I could. It was done in mostly pure JS, no jQuery or Bootstrap. Pure CSS was also used.
Some HTML5 and CSS3 was also used. Let me know if you have any more questions. Thank you for letting me participate in taking this test. In this project, I also included videos of the test in case, something happens. One for Safari and one for Chrome. 

Extra Credit portion: 
For the clock, I wish I could use Google's Time Zone API but I didn't want to import any library unless it was React or Sass as per instructions. So a switch statement was used instead since there was only a few locations. However, this would not be sustainable for > 10 locations.
